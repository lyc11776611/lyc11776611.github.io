## The Use of Blogs 博客的作用
It just feels like a long time ago when I really get in touch with blogs.<br/> Kinds of feeling that blogs are getting away from public vision.<br/> However, lately I found that most of the knowledge I grasped for programming and computers are from blogs! So I wonder if blogs can help organize my knowledge and to share it, if it can help some people. Not to mention that I think I do need to write something everyday to remind myself of what I have learned.<br/> Thus, let's write blogs! When things are abundant, I will try to make it searchable from Baidu to help more people! <br/><br/>
总觉得最近一次直接接触博客都是很久之前的事情了。<br/>
总感觉博客这东西在远离公众视线233<br/>
不过最近好像学习编程和计算机相关知识的时候来源都是博客？！所以或许写博客有助于我自己组织学习思路以及分享学习成果来帮助更多的人呢！更不用说我觉得我真的要把每天学了什么，做了什么甚至是想了什么写下来！<br/>
那么！开始写吧！当东西足够多的时候我就尝试一下弄得让百度能搜到这个2333。

Placed here is one of my favorite quote:
/在这放上哦最喜欢的话：

><font size=5><center>The currents before is ever-changing. <br/>
>We must adapt, press forward, if we are to see our journey's end.<br/>
>It is the nature of humankind to push itself toward the horizon.<br/>
>We test our limit;<br/>
>We face our fears;<br/>
>We rise to the challenge.<br/>
>And become something greater than ourselves.<br/><br/></font>
><font size=6>Civilization</font>

<center>In this everchanging society, I must force myself to think: <br/>How should humanity develop? What can I do for this development? And how can I do this in highest efficiency? <br/> Every time I remind myself of those beautiful futures human can have, I feels the eager and passions inside my mind. I really hope that my own effort will be indispensable for the development of humanity! Only through contributing myself to a greater cause can I really fulfill my passions, and to become something great in our history.</center>
<br/>

<center>在这个变换莫测，前所未有的时代，我必须努力思考：<br/>人类的未来应该如何发展？我能为人类和社会做什么？我怎样才能最高效的做成这些事情？<br/>每当想到人类可能的美好未来，心情总是不由自主的澎湃起来。啊，我真的希望，自己的努力能成为人类通往更加幸福的道路上必不可缺的一环！只有努力成就大我，才能满足内心潮涌的澎湃，并在历史的潮流下留下伟大的印记！</center>
